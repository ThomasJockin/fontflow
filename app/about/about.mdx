# About

Typography is at a crossroads. As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes creative disciplines, designers must navigate a landscape where machine-generated design is becoming increasingly sophisticated. **Font Flow: Typographic Experimentation in the Age of AI** explores the evolving relationship between human intuition and computational precision through the material language of typography.

## Too Many Choices, Too Little Guidance
The abundance of digital fonts, while a testament to technological progress, has created new challenges for designers:

### Motivations for Font Flow
- **Creative stagnation** – With thousands of fonts available, designers often default to familiar pairings rather than explore innovative combinations.
- **Lack of exposure to diverse typefaces** – Lesser-known, high-quality fonts often remain undiscovered due to inefficient search and categorization methods.
- **Typography education gaps** – Current instruction in typography prioritizes historical and anatomical understanding but offers little guidance on pairing strategies.

Faced with these challenges, graphic designers need a tool that encourages exploration and helps them break free from habitual choices.

## Prompt-Based Experimentation
Font Flow is designed to challenge designers by providing structured yet unexpected font pairings for typographic posters. Informed by research into ideation tools such as [**TypeCooker**](https://typecooker.com/) and [**Sharpen**](https://sharpen.design/), the Font Flow platform presents randomized constraints that push designers beyond their comfort zones.

### User selected complexity
- **Controlled randomness** – You can increase or decrease the level of complexity of the prompt.

### User selected complexity
- **Creative friction** – At the higher diffculties, the headline and subhead fonts also include formal typography adjustments based on lingustic or content relationships. These added requirements will force you to be more creative in your typography.

### An aid aganist procrastination
- **Time-Constraints** – The timer aspect of the site helps drive more creative thought by imposing a 90 minute limit to your sessions. 

This methodology mirrors the problem-solving nature of design, forcing practitioners to rethink how typography functions within composition.


## How Font Flow Enhances Learning
Font Flow is designed to be a long-term tool for typographers and designers. The **user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)** are crafted to facilitate deep engagement.

### UX and UI considerations
- **Minimalist, distraction-free design** – Encourages you to focus on typography rather than unnecessary UI elements.
- **Immediate feedback on constraints** – When you adjust the challenge level selector, you see in real time how complexity your design sprint session.
- **Community infrastructure** – When you review the gallery section of Font Flow, you are developing stronger critical and analytical skills.

## Beta-Testers Try Out Font Flow

Beta Testers—**Hrant H Papazian, Miguel Escamilla, Kateryna Kovalevska, and others**—engaged in a timed design sprint, each of them responding to a randomized typographic prompt. Like with the beat-testers, when you upload  work to the gallery section, Font Flow generates a design with the same prompt as you via [Ideogram 2.0](https://ideogram.ai/)'s API. When both designs are placed in the gallery section of the website, the works are stripped of their author attribution. 

### Explore the Gallery to see which designs are AI and Human made

## Reported Experiences
The gallery section prompts viewers to distinguish between human and AI made designs. The experience raises critical questions about authorship, creativity, and the evolving role of AI in graphic design. Can machines truly replace the human touch in typography? What does it mean to create something uniquely human in a world where AI can mimic stylistic decisions? The beta-testers for Font Flow reported surprise whenever they misattributed AI and human made work.

> ### User 1
> Moments where I missed the design as *AI* when there were clear markers of it. 

> ### User 2
> Were the part of hit the nail on the head of *AI vs human crafted*.


> ### User 3
>It was harder to find *what was AI* and *what was human*! I was like damn, it fooled me good.

> ### User 4
> Many of my guesses *(human vs. AI)* were wrong, and I realized that first impressions are not good enough, one has to carefully study a piece for clues.

> ### User 5
> I thought some of the posters were *made by humans*, but *they were AI*! I also thought the opposite about some of the human posters.


## AI vs. Human Typography: A Review Study
To further explore the relationship between AI and human creativity in typography, a small review study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of the designed posters.

### Method
- **20 designers** participated, rating AI-generated and human-made designs side by side. 10 were professional designers. 10 were design students.

Each artifact was reviewed acording to four criteria 

> ### Used Fonts
> Are the fonts in the design the ones assigned in the prompt?

> ### Knows Content
> Is the content of the university lecture understandable to the viewer?

> ### Knows Location
> Is the time, place, location of the lecture understableable?

> ### Visual Interest
> The visual interest of the design between a 1 to 5 star rating.

### Visual Interest and Content Correlation
- There is a **moderate correlation** (0.55) between the average visual interest and success percentage that the content meaning is clear in the poster. Consider this is a sample of creatives where one would would expect such reviewers to be the most capable to find a visual interesting without content meaning. 
- However, the R sqaure for the interaction between average visual interest and known content success rate is 0.3. This means 30% of the varaiton in the mean visual interest of an artifact is explained by content sucess rate. The remaining 70% of the variation in mean visual interest is explained by other variables.

### Visual Interest and Origin Correlations
- There is a **weak correlation** (0.22) between the average visual interest score and the origin of an artifact is attributed to the author, Thomas Jockin.
- There is practicially **no correlation** (0.009) between average visual interest and whether the design was AI or human made. For these reviewers, it is just as likely that a AI or Human design would be rated as visually interesting or boring

### Human v. AI Visual Interest
- There is **almost no difference** between the human and AI made designs in terms of mean visual interest. The average human made design recieved a visual interest rating of 3.0. AI made designs recieved a 2.9 average rating. 

### Head-to-Head Comparison
- However, when the human and AI made designs that used the same prompt were compared head-to-head according to the four criteria, **human made designs won 8 times for every time AI won.** This is because none of the Ideogram generated posters used the fonts required in the prompt. Meanwhile all human particants met this criteria requirement.  

The results suggest that AI models are not accurate enough, for now, to model typographic parameteres almost all human designers can execute. The author is aware forthcoming LLMs are in developlment that are trainned on the partiuclar font and typography parameters. Thus, this first conclusion is contingent to the writing of this thesis and will likely change in the future. 

On the otherhand, the average visual interest produced by the Ideogram 2.0 model is only slighly below human output at this time. We can already consider AI generated work as a benchmark measure for visual creativity for typographic work. Practioners and pupils may use AI generated work like we see in Font Flow to compare and refine their typographic creativity.

## Closing Remarks from the Author
Font Flow is part of the author's, Thomas Jockin, MFA thesis at Liberty University titled *Nuding Creativity in Typography with Font Pairing Prompts*. 

I do hope this website will be the start of many insightful conversations with designers and technologists interested in material culture and creativity. You may read the entire process and research conclusions in [the thesis PDF](../). I would like to thank you personally for reading this seciton of Font Flow. Please be sure to visit and try out the actual Font Flow website. I would like to give the following deidications for this thesis project. — Thomas Jockin, March 2025.

### Thank you
- **My thesis committee.** Thank you you Prof. Rebecca Cochell and Prof. Montonya for their feedback and guidence throughout the thesis process. The prompt to conduct beta-testing and user review of the design projects was directly because of the gudience of my comittee. 
- **My close friends.** I could not have competed this thesis without the mentorship of my friend and coding sensi, Micah Rich. Micah is avalaible for code mentorship and I highly encourage any designer who wants to learn front and backend development to work with Micah. He's the best. Kateryna Kovalevska is also someone who supported me throughout this thesis project with her willingness to test out my prototypes both in user interface and design sprints. 
- **Mom and Dad.** I love my parents very much and thankful they are in my life. I love you both.
