# About

Typography is at a crossroads. As artificial intelligence reshapes creative disciplines, designers must navigate a landscape where machine-generated design is becoming increasingly sophisticated. **Font Flow: Typographic Experimentation in the Age of AI** explores the evolving relationship between human intuition and computational precision through the material language of typography.

## Too Many Choices, Too Little Guidance
The abundance of digital fonts, while a testament to technological progress, has created new challenges for designers:

### Motivations for Font Flow
- **Creative stagnation** – With thousands of fonts available, designers often default to familiar pairings rather than exploring innovative combinations.
- **Lack of exposure to diverse typefaces** – Lesser-known, high-quality fonts often remain undiscovered due to inefficient search and categorization methods.
- **Typography education gaps** – Current instruction in typography prioritizes historical and anatomical understanding but offers little guidance on pairing strategies.

Faced with these challenges, graphic designers need a tool that encourages exploration and helps them break free from habitual choices.

## Prompt-Based Experimentation
Font Flow is designed to challenge designers by providing structured yet unexpected font pairing prompts. Inspired by research into ideation tools like **TypeCooker** and **Sharpen.design**, the Font Flow platform presents randomized constraints that push designers beyond their comfort zones.

- **Controlled randomness** – You can increase or decrease the level of complexity of the prompt.

- **Creative friction** – At the higher diffculties, the headline and subhead fonts also include formal typography adjustments based on lingustic or content relationships. These added requirements will force you to be more creative in your typography.

- **Time-Constraints** – The timer aspect of the site helps drive more creative thought by imposing a 90 minute limit to your sessions. 

This methodology mirrors the problem-solving nature of design, forcing practitioners to rethink how typography functions within composition.

## Beta-Testers Try Out Font Flow


Beta Testers—**Hrant H Papazian, Miguel Escamilla, Kateryna Kovalevska, and others**—engaged in a timed design sprint, each of us responding to a randomized typographic prompt. When we uploaded our work to the gallery section of the website, the design was then placed alongside AI-generated designs, stripped of attribution. 

### Find out if design is AI or Human
![image 4](/PNGs/img-5.png "title")
The gallery section prompts viewers to distinguish between human and AI made designs. The experience raises critical questions about authorship, creativity, and the evolving role of AI in graphic design. Can machines truly replace the human touch in typography? What does it mean to create something uniquely human in a world where AI can mimic stylistic decisions?

## How Font Flow Enhances Learning
Font Flow is designed to be a long-term tool for typographers and designers. The **user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)** are crafted to facilitate deep engagement.

### UX and UI considerations
- **Minimalist, distraction-free design** – Encourages focus on typography rather than unnecessary UI elements.
- **Instant feedback on constraints** – Users see how prompt modifications impact their challenges in real time.
- **Collaborative critique system** – By engaging with the gallery sections, users develop stronger critical and analytical skills.

## AI vs. Human Typography: The Review Study
To further explore the relationship between AI and human creativity, a small review study was conducted.

### Method
- **20 designers** participated, rating AI-generated and human-made designs side by side. 10 were professional designers. 10 were design students.
- **Each artifact was reviewed acording to four criteria** Was the fonts in the design the ones assigned in the prompt? Is the content of the university lecture understandable to the viewer? Is the time, place, location of the lecture understableable? The visual interest of the design between a 1 to 5 star rating.  

### Key Findings
- There is a **moderate correlation** (0.55) between the average visual interest and success percentage that the content meaning is clear in the poster. Consider this is a sample of creatives where one would would expect such reviewers to be the most capable to find a visual interesting without content meaning.
- There is a **weak correlation** (0.22) between the average visual interest score and if the origin of the design was from the author, Thomas Jockin.
- There is practicially **no correlation** (0.009) between average visual interest and whether the design was AI or human made. For these reviewers, it is just as likely that a AI or Human design would be rated as visually interesting or boring
- There is **almost no difference** between the human and AI made designs in terms of mean visual interest. The average human made design recieved a visual interest rating of 3.0. AI made designs recieved a 2.9 average rating. 
- However, when the human and AI made designs that used the same prompt were compared head-to-head according to the four criteria, **human made designs won 8 times for every time AI won.** This is because none of the Ideogram generated posters used the fonts required in the prompt. Meanwhile all human particants easily met this requirement.  

The results reinforced the unique value of human intuition in typographic design while highlighting AI’s potential as a supporting tool rather than a replacement.

## Conclusion
Font Flow is part of my MFA thesis at Libery University. It is my hope this website will be the start of many insightful conversations with designers and technologists interested in material culture and creativity. You can read the entire process and research conclusions in this thesis PDF. I would like to thank you personally for reading this about seciton of Font Flow. Please be sure to visit and try out the actual Font Flow website. I will also like to give the following deidications for this thesis project.

### Thank you
- **My thesis committee.** Thank you you Prof. Rebecca Cochell and Prof. Montonya for their feedback and guidence throughout the thesis process. The prompt to conduct beta-testing and user review of the design projects was directly because of gudience my the thesis comittee. 
- **My close friends.** I could not have competed this thesis without the mentorship by my friend and coding sensi, Micah Rich. Micah is avalaible for code coaching and I highly encourage any designer wanted to learn front and backend development to work with Micah. He's the best. Kateryna Kovalevska is also someone who supported me throughout this thesis project with her willingness to test out my prototypes both in user interface and design sprints. 
- **My family.** I love my parents very much and thankful they are in my life. I love you mom and dad.
